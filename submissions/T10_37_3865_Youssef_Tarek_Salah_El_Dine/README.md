"It was stated in the pdf that i could use the language of my choice so i chose Javascript, sorry for the inconvenience however i will guide you through how to use my javascript file safely.
I submitted the following directory tree

```
T10_37_3865_Youssef_Tarek_Salah_El_Dine/ (main directory)
    ./README.md (current file you're reading)
    ./CFG_submit.js
```

I am not sure if you have `yarn` and `node` installed on your machine.
However, i have provided this `.md` file to instruct through the process for running the file."

# With `node`:

### Missing `yarn`:

If you are willing to install yarn, [here's the link for yarn installer download](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/latest.msi).

#### Install dependencies with `yarn`:

After a successful yarn installation.
Please go to the directory where my submited file exists, and run the following commands:
`yarn add --dev yargs chalk`

Now just run the `CFG_submit.js` file using `node ./CFG_submit.js --cfgString "S,o,aS;L,k,LT"`

# Without `node`:

Well in that case, please use my online made small javascript compiler page to test the answers. [Click here](https://js.do/tacosjr/422173)
